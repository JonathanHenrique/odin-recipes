    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Inspired by the pizza at Bar Del Corso, this Pizza Margherita features tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, with just a hint of sea salt.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <Ul>
        <li>3 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
        <li>20 leaves fresh basil</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </Ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. </li>
        <li>When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
